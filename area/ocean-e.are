The Eastern Shores~
You are standing on the eastern shores of Arcanis and the Silver Sea. 
The waters stretch farther than the eye can see as the Silver Sea meets the
Great Barrier Sea in a vast nothingness.  Gulls fly over head and the
crashing of waves can be heard on the beach.  There is a sense of loneliness
that lays on these waters that can be felt deep within you.  The shore is
covered with many shells and small rocks here.

A shoreline~
The damp sand underfoot slowly sinks down as you step on it.  There are
many rocks and shells laying about as the rhythmic pulses from the waves can
almost be felt.  Towards land the hills are beginning to rise into higher
rock walls to the north.  To the south the shore continues on as the land of
Arcanis lays low.

Great Barrier Sea in a vast nothingness.  Gulls fly over head and the
crashing of waves can be heard on the beach.  There is a sense of loneliness
that lays on these waters that can be felt deep within you.  The shore is
covered with many shells and small rocks here.

You are surrounded by the peaceful gray waters of the Silver Sea.  The waters surround
and protect the Arcanis continent and there is a magical feel in the air.  These waters
have long been the domain of the sea elves who traverse their waves.

A turning point in the western shore~
You are standing at a bend in the shore.  To north is the western shore
which continues north far past the port of Arcanis.  To the southeast the
shore bends and travels towards the southern points of the Silver Sea.  The
salty air of the oceans gray waters seems very strong here.
