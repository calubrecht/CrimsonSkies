Entrance to the Midgaard Dueling Grounds~
You are standing at the entrance to the Midgaard dueling grounds.  There
are large stone walls hovering around the grounds which create an small open
air arena.  A single guard stands at the gate making sure that none of the
fighting from inside spills out into the peaceful city streets.

Inside the Dueling Grounds~
You are standing inside the stone gates of the dueling grounds.  You can
see that you are standing at a higher elevation than the floor of the
grounds where the fighting occurs.  Open hallways extend northwest and
northeast that encircle the floor of the grounds.  There appears to be a
portal here that takes participants to the fighting floor. 
 
There is a sign here which reads "Beware, there are no rules in the dueling
grounds.  All skill levels are welcome and all skill levels must be beware that
upon entering they must be prepared to fight."
