A Clearing Near the Silver Sea~
You see the vast openness of the Silver Sea to the west.  Seagulls fly all 
about and waves slowly pulse onto the sands of the beach.  A port stands to 
the west where large and small boats alike enter and leave.  To the east you
see a small forest.

Red Oak Road near the Silver Sea~
You stand on a trail amid a small, green forest.  You can hear the sounds
of woodland creatures and a warm, salty breeze from the west rustling
through the trees and your hair.  Far to the east, you barely make out a
city and to the west the Silver Sea lines the horizon.

Western Red Oak Road~
Far to the east you can see the gates of the mighty city of Red Oak.  To
the west you can still smell the sea breeze.  The forest has dwindled down
into a field here but looks to fill out again to the east.  Perhaps the trees 
that once stood here are what built Red Oak.

Middle of a Huge Field~
You stand in the middle of a field that seems to be surrounded by forest
on both sides.  The salt air of the sea is beginning to diminish here.

Western Red Oak Road~
From the middle of the field, you can just make out the tips of the sails
in the port to the west, but Red Oak's city gates are looming to the east. 
The trees all around you seem young and fresh, fragile as the breeze sends
another wave of leaves down at the edges of the field.  A smaller road leads
to the south from here.

Near the Eastern Gates of Red Oak~
As you stand at the eastern edge of the field, surrounded on the north
and south by forest.  Eastward lays the city of Red Oak.

Outside Red Oak's West Gate~
The shiny gates of Red Oak lie before you, tall and imposing.  You can see
guards on the other side of the gates, milling about silently, waiting for
something to happen.  A road trails off to the west, to the horizon, while a
small paved path leads into Red Oak.

Blade Dancer's Road~
You are standing on a small but well traveled path that runs north and
south.  To the north is Red Oak Road which runs east and west through
Arcanis.  To the south appears to be sparse trees which have grown up in the
fields.  There also appears to be what looks like an establishment to the
south.  To the east you can hear the clashing of swords on armor as if there
was a battle going on.

Outside the Blade Dancer's Inn~
You are standing outside the Blade Dancer's Inn.  There are lights coming
from within and horses tied off outside.  The crowd appears to be small in
this corner of the world as the inn looks like it has seen better days.  
 
There appears to be a large door to the south that grants access to the
inn.

Outside Red Oak's Northern Gate~
You are standing outside of the northern gates of the town of Red Oak. 
The dusty and worn you are on continues on to the north while the gates of
the city are to your south.  There are giant red oak trees that fill in the
surroundings but not so close that the light from the sun and moon can't
make it through.

Along the Northern Road~
You are standing on the the dusty path of the northern road.  Sparse red
oak trees line the fields to the east and west and the lights of the town of

Along the Northern Road~
The nothern road comes to an abrupt end here at a rocky ledge that leads
sharply down into the deep chasm's of the nothern valley.  To the west you
can see a drab structure which appears to be some sort of prison.  To the
northwest you can see the looming Gray Mountains in the distance.

Before the Gates of Red Oak~
The sky glows with the light from the city of Red Oak.  The light from
the torches placed on the gates illuminate the rutted, muddy ground sloping
down to the east.

Rutted Hill~
Deep ruts mar the ground, created by carts pulled up the muddy hill to
supply Red Oak with the needed goods to support it's population.  Some of
the ruts are very wide and filled with water and muck.

Before the rutted hill~
To the west is the "Great mudslide" as it is known throughout the world,
the trade route to the west gate of Red Oak.  To the east lies the Great
Forest.  The ground here is somewhat muddy with small ruts creating a swath
of crisscrossing lines.

A small dirt road~
The road you are on continues off interminably to the east, while back to
the west Red Oak can be seen glimmering in the light.  Huge trees, and lots
of them, line the horizon to the northeast, their gentle leaves swaying in
the light breeze.

A small road~
Leaves drift by on the wind from the trees to the north.  You're sure the
entrance to the Forest is around here somewhere.  Smells from the kitchen's
in Red Oak are apparent as you glance back towards the town, to the west. 
The road you are on continues off to the east, losing itself on the horizon.

A small dirt road~
The mighty trees of the Great Forest rise before you to the north, their
massive trunks twisting towards the sky in savage grace.  To the west, the
sounds and smells of Red Oak are barely present.
