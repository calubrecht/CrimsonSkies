maniacal prisoner~
a maniacal prisoner~
A maniacal prisoner giggles insanely at you.

This poor soul has been in here so long it has broken his mind. No one even
remembers why he is here.

turnkey~
a drunken turnkey~
The turnkey snores loudly as he sleeps off another binge.
~
His job bores him to tears. No one ever tries to escape. His duties are
limited to escorting prisoners to and from their cells, and occasionally
beating a noisy or frightened prisoner into submission. So he spends most
(heck, ALL) of his time drinking.

inquisitor~
the inquisitor~
The inquisitor stands here, extracting "confessions".
~
He seems somewhat puzzled by your presence, then shrugs and turns back to
his task. The world is full of sickos, and if you get your jollies watching
a man being tortured to death, well... that's how he gets his, too.

master torturer~
the master torturer~
The master torturer grins wickedly and gives the rack another turn.
~
This gap-toothed moron is quite adept at causing hapless prisoners exquisite
pain without any grave danger to their lives. And, what's more, he enjoys it!
Job satisfaction is SO important, really. I mean, if you don't enjoy your
job, what have you got?

a noble prisoner~
A noble prisoner is being kept here.
~
This fellow was imprisoned by the Castellan for offensive behavior towards
the Castellan's daughter during the Castellan's Ball held recently. He is of

a price, of course.

KEEP OUT!

A trapdoor leads upward to the city square, where prisoners who are
sentenced to death are led for their execution.

This is the most feared place in all the dungeon. Any and all prisoners who
end up here rarely leave in one piece. And even if they do, they are usually
driven quite insane by the weeks of torture. Long chains hanging from the

being subjected to cruel tortures on the nightmarish devices below.
