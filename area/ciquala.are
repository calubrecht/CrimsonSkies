A room with a large pool of water in the center~
This room has a large pool of black water in the center.  You see
many runes and glyphs surrounding it.  The room is lit by torches held in
sconces.  Each of these items in the room merits more investigation.

pool~
As you lean forward and look in the pool, you see nothing but the dark
murky water.  Gradually though, an image forms before you.  You recognize the
person the image shows.  It is the Avatar!  Apparently this is a pool that
Ciquala uses to scry upon her enemies. The image is so clear, you almost
believe you could step into the pool, and appear in Lord British's castle.
~
E
torches~
The torches are made of a black wood, and as you draw nearer, you find
that they do not emit any heat.  Indeed, they seem to be radiating cold.  The
flames are an icy blue, that makes you think twice about getting too close to
them.

The sconces are black and shaped liked two hands, cradling the torches
between their pointed nails.
