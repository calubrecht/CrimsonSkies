The dark woods~
You are traveling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees
above block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and
decay. The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and
you feel very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path
leads east and south into the darkness of the forest.

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal
trees line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light
spear down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of
light that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest
floor. The path winds west and east into darkness.

On a broken road~
The ground beneath you gives noticeably as you step along what is left of
the broken road once known as the Gray Pass. The mountain canyon to the west
has retreated, giving way to strange, twisted trees. A foul mist hangs in
the air, reeking of decay.

On a broken road~
Walking along the broken road you notice that as you step on patches of
earth that they are becoming spongier. Also, the tall, sturdy trees of the
mountain canyon are dwindling away and becoming thinner. The broken path
continues to the west and leads into a darkening forest to the east.

On a broken road~
You walk along a broken stone roadway built long before this age of the world.
The road cuts through a wide canyon in the Gray Mountains, though it
levels out the farther east you travel. A few evergreen trees rise up around
you, growing denser as the canyon receeds. The stone path continues to the
east and west.
