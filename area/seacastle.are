A Large Balcony~
A large balcony protrudes out barely sitting over the rising waves of the
ocean.  The stone seems worn from the waves of the sea as you feel a piece
of moss roll over your feet.  To the north lies a large arch-way leading
into the castle.

Inside a Bedroom~
The light from the arch-way streams into the room and dimly lights its
contents.  On the floor you see a small comfortable looking bed covered in
dried moss.  To the east looks to be a small closet and to the north is
large stone door.  A {Cglowing{x globe lays in the corner of the room.

globe~
The swirling mist of blue and grey from within the globe seems to become
more intense as you look deeper into it.  As you look longer the mist clears
and you see the images of the rolling waves over a calm and peaceful sea. 
Within moments thought the sky begins to cloud over and waves begin from at
first small but then higher and higher gaining with intensity and strength. 
The howling winds move faster and faster as a deep rumbling can be heard
from far beneath the ocean.  The rumbling becomes louder and louder as the
waves roll higher and higher off of the surface of the water.  Suddenly,
from the surface in quick jagged movements you see the parts of the once
majestic castle collapse under the water and parts such as the pinnacle 
of a tower left protruding. The rumbling continues louder and louder and 
the waves thrash violently.  As quick as it began...  The God's halted the 
acts of nature...  The rumbling disapated as the waves began to slowly 
return closer to the surface water.  The clouds in the sky cleared slowly 
as a kingdom ended in tragedy.

This seems to be the last room left down the barren and now destroyed
hallway.  It's a rather small room as not much but a couple of shelves are

Illerion's Chambers~
You stand in the chambers of the first great sea-elf king Illerion. 
Embeded in the walls are decorative jewels in every fashion that you could
possibly imagine.  The ceiling is rather high here as the room nearly looks to
be a hall.

Illerion's Chambers~
All around the chamber you almost seem to hear a haunting echo.  You see
nothing here but the remains of what used to as if it were a bed.  The stone
floor at your feet looks as if it has began to crack and deteriorate with age.
On a small stone table in the corner you see a {Dbook{x which looks as if it
hasn't been moved in ages upon ages.

book~
You would think that the parchment in this book would have deteriated
moments after entering the water but strangly enought it looks as if it were
just turned out from a shop.  As you examine the writings you read a passage
from the last page:

The days seem to be growing rather short.  The rising tension of the spirit
of the ocean is weighing heavily upon all of our minds.  The rumblings... 
From deep within it's bed can be heard throughout our kingdom and have many
of my followers in a panic.  All seems to be in a more or less chaotic
state.  At wake tomorrow, I venture forth to the nearby sea's in an
attempt to tame the rising aggresion of the sea life.  

Day of Deception, 9th 'the Month of the Shadows'.

You seem to be trapped in a bit of a mystic void...  Pure and utter
darkness lays around you in all directions.  You can feel a presence with
you and the air seems to be humming as it rolls across your skin with a
faint breeze.

Base of the South Tower~
The banister of the staircase leading upwards appears to be made of ivory
with bright glittering jewels embedded every foot or so.  The carvings on
the wall seem to be more intricate here than in any other part of the
castle.  The images of sea-elves nearly seem to spring out of the walls at
you.
