Changes made for Windows support (Tested on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 & 10 with Visual Studio 2017)

Visual Studio Project Changes

To fix sprintf errors in VS:
    - Project Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Defintions
    - Add Disable _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE

To fix net errors add winsock:
    - Project Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies
    - Add wsock32.lib

To fix:
	- Error C4996: 'unlink': The POSIX name for this item is deprecated. Instead, use the ISO C++ conformant name: _unlink
	- Put _WIN32 directive in to call _unlink for Windows, link for anything else

To fix:
	- Error C4996: 'close': The POSIX name for this item is deprecated. Instead, use the ISO C++ conformant name: _close
	- Put _WIN32 directive in to call _close for Windows, link for anything else

To fix:
    - error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'sys/time.h': No such file or directory
	- Put directives in all files for _WIN32 to point to time.h.  A pain but I want to do it in the code and not be copying
	  to the sys directory so this works out of the box for people who fork it.

To fix:
	- error C2079: 'now_time' uses undefined struct 'timeval'
	- Add _WIN32 include for winsock.h

To fix:
	- error C4996: 'write': The POSIX name for this item is deprecated. Instead, use the ISO C++ conformant name: _write. See online help for details.
	- Add _WIN32 code and change write to _write
	- Alt fix, use send instead of write in Windows.

To fix:
	- error E1696: cannot open source file "winsock2.h"
	- Open the Project -> CrimsonSkies Properties -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Set the Platform Toolset to v141_xp (or any versions that target xp, various may work)

Additional Notes:

    - crypt has been replaced with a sha256 hashing function for passwords.  Depending on the endianness of the machine, this could potentially return a different hash.
	- rename which renames a file works differently in Windows/VS.  In most POSIX implementations you can rename a file to one that already exists and it will
	  overwrite.  In Windows, it fails, which means stuff like pfiles never save after the first time.  In Windows the file you are renaming too must be deleted
	  first (with _unlink).
	- In order to run in Debug, a Visual Studio project properties change has to be made to tell VS to start in the same working directory as the executable.  Under
	  "Project->Properties->Working Directory" from "$(ProjectDir)" to "$(SolutionDir)$(Configuration)\".
