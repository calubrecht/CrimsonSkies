### MobProgs

MobProgs or Mobile Programs are a way to add behaviors to mobs without actually writing C code that needs to be compiled into the code base.  MobProgs are snippits of a custom language that are stored in the area file and attached to a mob.  These are not as full featured as something like Lua can provide but can all you to create basic behaviors to tailors your creatures.
