# CS-Mud 1.0 Documentation

### Supported Operating Systems

Currently Crimson Skies compiles and runs out of the box on:

  - Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (Primary focus)
  - Rasbian for use with the RaspberryPi
  - Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10

CS-Mud will likely also compile on Debian with little if any changes (as Raspbian is a deriative of Debian).  It will likely work on many Linux distributions although I only test currently on those above.
