Crimson Skies Mud (CS-Mud)
==========================

Crimson Skies is an open source MUD starting from ROM 2.4b6.  Useful features from other open source code bases
(like Smaug) will be included on top mostly custom code.  My goal is to expand the Diku code line while
keeping the feel of play that the Diku->Merc->Rom family of muds has brought the community over the years.

  - Development Game Server Address:  66.244.102.112, Port 4000

If you would like to contribute areas, code, etc. feel free to contact me and/or issue a pull request when you're
contribution is complete.  If you have found a bug, file an issue here with details or steps to recreate so I can 
fix it.  I invite and welcome any contributions.  Great muds are a combination of the code and the content.  You
can't have just one or the other.  Although CS-Mud is newish to open source/GitHub is has been under private
development since 1998 as my hobby.

Currently Crimson Skies compiles and runs out of the box on:

  - Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS
  - Rasbian for use with the RaspberryPi
  - Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 - Compiles with Visual Studio 2015 Community, for your initial 
    compile/run in Visual Studio you may need to follow the instructions in this blog post, 
    they are brief: [http://www.blakepell.com/how-to-change-working-directory-in-visual-studio-for-a-cc-app)](http://www.blakepell.com/how-to-change-working-directory-in-visual-studio-for-a-cc-app)

CS-Mud will likely also compile on Debian with little if any changes (as Raspbian is a deriative of Debian).

## Resources

Unfortunately over the years the best resources have been lost to time.  I will try to
provide new documentation and archive old documentation as I can find it.  The best 
old resource was the rom mailing list but alas it does not exist at it's old locations
which were at:

  - [http://www.the-infinite.org/lists/romlist](http://www.the-infinite.org/lists/romlist)

Here are some related resources that are thanksfully still active.

  - Gammon Forums (Smaug & ROM) - [http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/](http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/)

## License 

I have no specific license for my code at this time, but as this is a ROM/Merc/Diku deritivate it must 
adhear to the licenses set before it from those code bases.
