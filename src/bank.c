   *  Based on: Simple banking system. by -- Stephen --
   *
   *  The following changes and additions where made by the Maniac
   *  from Mythran Mud (v942346@si.hhs.nl)
   *
   *  History:
   *  05/18/1996:     Added the transfer option, enables chars to transfer
   *                  money from their account to other players' accounts
   *  05/18/1996:     Big bug detected, can deposit/withdraw/transfer
   *                  negative amounts (nice way to steal is
   *                  bank transfer -(lots of dogh)
   *                  Fixed it (thought this was better... -= Maniac =-)
   *  06/21/1996:     Fixed a bug in transfer (transfer to MOBS)
   *                  Moved balance from ch->balance to ch->pcdata->balance
   *  06/21/1996:     Started on the invest option, so players can invest
   *                  money in shares, using buy, sell and check
   *                  Finished version 1.0 releasing it monday 24/06/96
   *  06/24/1996:     Mythran Mud Economy System V1.0 released by Maniac
   *  03/01/2017:     Investing removed.
   *  03/03/2017:     Bank will only store gold, silver is more of an annoyance
   *                  for players.  The bank will however allow for silver to
   *                  be exchanged for gold which can then be deposited.
   *  03/04/2017:     Logging of deposits and withdrawls.
